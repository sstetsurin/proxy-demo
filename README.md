# proxy-demo
Simple example of proxy implementation

To run you can use `npm start`

If it is not possible to run node.js on the back-end side of server,
feel free to use nginx proxy implementation on your server, see http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html and don't forget to add Access-Control-Allow-Origin headers
